                How many trees are in the Amazon?
            </h1>
            <p>
                As you’ll see on all Amazon tours in Brazil, if there’s one thing that the Amazon is not lacking, its trees. Though counting each and every tree in the jungle is impossible, scientists have undertaken several studies and surveys to determine the approximate number of trees, placing the number at a huge 400 billion.

In fact, around a third of the world’s tree species can be found in the Amazon, though more and more are being lost each day due to deforestation and illegal logging.

                Which is the tallest tree in the Amazon?
            </h1>
            <p>
                The tallest tree in the Amazon is the Sumaumeira. A species of the Kapok tree, the Sumaumeira can grow to heights of 200 feet and diameters of more than ten feet, towering above their neighbours high up in the jungle canopy.

                Found on the floodplains of jungle rivers, this fast growing tree is easy to spot on Amazon tours in Brazil thanks to the distinctive above ground roots that protect the tree from flood waters during the wet season.

                Though the Sumaumeira is the tallest, there are hundreds of other enormous trees in the Amazon, each towering hundreds of feet above the jungle floor.

                How quickly is the Amazon Rainforest in Brazil being deforested?
            </h1>
            <p>
                Brazilians have settled large portions of the Amazon, clearing the land for lumbering, grazing, and agriculture. Between 1970 and 2016, Brazilian Amazon forest cover declined from some 1,583,000 square miles to about 1,283,000 square miles. However, conservation slowed forest loss to roughly 0.1–0.2 percent per year between 2008 and 2016.

                What is the maximum age of a tree?
            </h1>
            <p>
                The Sarv-e Abarkuh (Abarkuh Cypress) is thought to be among the earliest trees in the world as its age is approximated to be in between 4,000– 5,000 years. It is tough to position a specific age on the tree, yet it has actually been cultivated for several years.

                How old is an average tree?
            </h1>
            <p>
                The typical age of a tree depends of the varieties. Palms which are brief lived can live upto 40– 50 years of age. The willow can live upto 75 years.
